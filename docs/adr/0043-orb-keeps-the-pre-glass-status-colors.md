# 0043. The orb keeps the pre-Glass status colors; offline is a gray Wi-Fi off

- **Status:** accepted (amends the orb colors of ADR-0032, the offline icon of ADR-0033 / ADR-0038, where ADR-0038's Pulse Alarm loop starts, and ADR-0034's tray palette and Offline picture)
- **Date:** 2026-10-02
- **Deciders:** Esi-Abolfazl

## Context

The Glass redesign brightened the state palette and gave the orb five moods: v0.6.5's four
(ok, warn, alarm, checking) plus offline, in a new crimson, with checking in gray. The owner
wants the orb's colors to stay what users already know.

## Decision

- The orb's `--sev` reads `--mood-*` tokens (`tokens.css`) with the v0.6.5 values: warn `#f2792b`,
  alarm `#e03131`. Green and busy yellow are a little darker than v0.6.5's (`#1fb872`, `#ffcc00`):
  ok `#1a9c61`, busy (checking) `#e6b400`, so they stand out more, above all on a light menu bar,
  and busy no longer equals the brand yellow.
- Offline, new since v0.6.5, takes the gray the redesign gave checking (`--state-checking`).
- Every other mood keeps its rings/pulse icon and motion. Idle stays gray.
- Offline draws one **Wi-Fi off** icon in every orb style (`WIFI_OFF` in `orbIcons.tsx`): three
  arcs dashed like Alarm's rings, spanning the rings' width, a dot, and Offline's slash. The arcs
  sink and the slash fades, as the offline rings did; each style keeps its own stroke weight.
- Offline disables the orb: no network on this machine is not something a refresh can fix, and
  the scheduled checks pick the connection up on their own. Its tooltip says so.
- Pulse Alarm's 20 s loop is entered 2.5 s in, on the dead line: arriving in Alarm (often right
  after a refresh) showed ~2 s of a calm-looking red heartbeat first, which read as "fine". The
  heartbeat and its drain still replay near the end of every loop.
- The menu-bar icon shows what the orb shows: the same `--mood-*` colors (Rust constants in
  `tray.rs`, checked against `tokens.css` by a test), the same Wi-Fi off for Offline in all four
  looks (bare and filled), and its tray-menu list dots follow, as they always matched the icon.
- The `--state-*` palette for rows and service dots is untouched.

## Alternatives considered

- **Revert the `--state-*` tokens** — would also recolor rows and the tray, which was not asked.
- **Keep offline crimson** — two reds side by side; gray reads "nothing is reachable".
- **A stock Wi-Fi-off glyph** — reads fine alone but not as one of the orb's states.
- **Keep refresh clickable offline** — it would start a round that can only fail.
- **Drop the heartbeat from Pulse Alarm** — fixes the arrival too, but loses the PR's drain story.

## Consequences

**Positive:** the main status light looks as it did before the redesign.

**Negative / accepted trade-offs:** the orb and the rows use slightly different greens, oranges
and reds; busy yellow is still near the brand yellow, though no longer equal to it.
The Pulse look loses its frame when offline, as the orb's Pulse loses its line: Offline is one
picture everywhere. The Settings picker (`trayIcons.tsx`) still redraws the Rust shapes by hand;
only the colors have a parity test, the geometry does not.

**Follow-ups:** a geometry parity check between `tray.rs` and `trayIcons.tsx` (TODO.md).
